====================

Processing code to make the images for a paper and transparency animation.


Here's a video showing how it looks: http://youtu.be/iHg7f35PrEY

The sketch looks at a folder within the processing sketch folder which contains images of the different frames.
It combines the frames in a way such that when printed on paper and placed under a selectively transparent filter,
when the filter is rotated an illusion of the image animating can be seen.

There are two versions of this sketch, the first has the rotation point in the middle and the other, more recent version,
has the point of rotation above the image (title appended with rock).
Here's what the second version of the file produces: http://youtu.be/nBGgfLNXTsc (I'll try to upload a clearer one)

The site I have used to convert a gif into frames is: http://gifmaker.me/exploder/

You will need the processing software to use this code and that is available: https://processing.org/download/
